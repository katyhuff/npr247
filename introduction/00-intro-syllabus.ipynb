    "Rather than spending time in class to introduce concepts for the first time, I think our time is better spent if we focus on exploring those concepts through demonstration and discussion together. **This 'active learning' educational strategy is backed by science, but is also just more respectful of your ability to learn things on your own.** Therefore, the lectures will assume you have studied the background materials ahead of time. This will include book sections, government reports, videos, and other resources. You will be expected to study the material outside of class before the start of each week. I recommend you take notes on this material as any of it may be assessed in the exams.\n",

So, for a 3 credit class, you'll need to spend 3 hours a week in class and 9 hours outside of class on the coursework. If you find you're spending much less or much more time on this class, please let me know. \n",

Please note that such a letter is appropriate for many types of conflicts, but that religious conflicts require special early handling. In accordance with university policy, students seeking an excused absence for religious reasons should complete the Request for Accommodation for Religious Observances Form, which can be found on the Office of the Dean of Students website. The student should submit this form to the instructor and the Office of the Dean of Students by the end of the second week of the course to which it applies."
