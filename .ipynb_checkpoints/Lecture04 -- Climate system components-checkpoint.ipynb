      ">Figure 1.1 | Main drivers of climate change. The radiative balance between incoming solar shortwave radiation (SWR) and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is influenced by global climate \u2018drivers\u2019. Natural fluctuations in solar output (solar cycles) can cause changes in the energy balance (through fluctuations in the amount of incoming SWR) (Section 2.3). Human activity changes the emissions of gases and aerosols, which are involved in atmospheric chemical reactions, resulting in modified O3 and aerosol amounts (Section 2.2). O3 and aerosol particles absorb, scatter and reflect SWR, changing the energy balance. Some aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei modifying the properties of cloud droplets and possibly affecting precipitation (Section 7.4). Because cloud interactions with SWR and LWR are large, small changes in the properties of clouds have important implications for the radiative budget (Section 7.4). Anthropogenic changes in GHGs (e.g., CO2, CH4, N2O, O3, CFCs) and large aerosols (>2.5 \u03bcm in size) modify the amount of outgoing LWR by absorbing outgoing LWR and re-emitting less energy at a lower temperature (Section 2.2). Surface albedo is changed by changes in vegetation or land surface properties, snow or ice cover and ocean colour (Section 2.3). These changes are driven by natural seasonal and diurnal changes (e.g., snow cover), as well as human influence (e.g., changes in vegetation types) (Forster et al., 2007)."

      " - Land surface model\n",
      " - Sea ice model\n",
      "\n",
      "The software is somewhat modular, so different submodels can be combined together depending on the nature of the scientific problem at hand and the available computer power.\n",
      "\n",
      "E.g. we can run the model in \u201catmosphere-only\u201d mode. Surface conditions over land and ocean will be prescribed from observations.\n",
      "**It is difficult to learn much about climate change this way.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the **surface temperature can\u2019t change in response to energy imbalance!**\n",
